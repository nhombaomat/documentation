Drupal 9 sites on Pantheon have Composer built-in to manage site dependencies.

For a smooth upgrade experience, and to avoid potential conflicts, this doc shows how to migrate a Drupal 8 site without Composer to a Drupal 9 site with Integrated Composer.

The goals of this upgrade are to remove dependencies that Composer will manage from the existing site's Git repository, and have Composer manage those dependencies in the new site instead.

Note that since you are migrating a site through this process, the new site will no longer maintain your existing commit history.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

To maintain best practice and to avoid difficult, time-consuming repairs to the site, this doc is written for users with access to Pantheon's [Multidev](/multidev) feature.

Pantheon support is not available to users who avoid the Multidev steps.

## Change Upstreams

Set the site to use the Drupal 9 Upstream:

```bash{promptUser:user}
terminus site:upstream:set $site drupal9
```

Enter `yes` when prompted:

```bash
Are you sure you want change the upstream for anita-drupal to Drupal 9? (yes/no) [no]:
```

Note that only the [User in Charge](/change-management#site-level-roles-and-permissions) can set the Upstream.
